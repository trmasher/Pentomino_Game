# Pentomino_Game
This code represents an iteration of a variation of the popular game Tetris; however, whereas Tetris makes use of the free polyominoes of order 4 (the "tetrominoes"), this game makes use of the free polyominoes of order 5 (the "pentominoes"). 



## Credits and Recommendations
This game was built entirely upon the foundation of the code "Tetromino (a Tetris clone)" by Al Sweigart, which can be found [by following this URL](https://inventwithpython.com/tetromino.py). I make particular note that all portions of the code that are identical to Al's program were created by him, and any similar portions of code were in-all-liklihood inspired by his code. All credit for the foundation of the program as it appears in this repository belong to him. 

If you would like to learn how to use the pygame module ([available here!](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)) to create games like this one, I would highly recommend picking up his text "Making Games with Python & Pygame: A guide to programming with graphics, animation, and sound" (which you can purchase a copy of [from here](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730)).



## Goal of this Project
As you might have known (or managed to guess after a quick Google search of "Pentominoes"), being able to actually complete even a single line or two using the (free) pentominoes is not particularly likely. So why pentominoes then? Particularly, it was because I **(1)** wanted to see if I could apply what I've learned about the pygame module to attempt to make edits to a pre-existing game in a way that helped me understand the program better, and **(2)** to investigate how I could use loops, functions, the numpy module, and the pandas module to create a program that is both robust enough to handle more variable inputs effectively as well as flexible enough to be more easily edited and built upon by other users.

This is an *extremely* early work-in-progress; I am predominately uploading this project to archive my progression, so it will contain excess amounts of scratch-work and former lines of code as indented comments that have been depreciated from the current code.
